All models require having GEModelTools set-up in order to run them. 
See https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/GEModelToolsNotebooks for details. 

After setting up GEModelToos, the main results can be replicated running the HANK.ipynb file found here:
\two_sectors_subsistence\two_sector\HANK.ipynb

File-names ending with _baseline can be used to run a standard 1-sector model for comparison.
